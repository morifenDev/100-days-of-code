# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finish "Learn the Command Line"

**Thoughts:** We use our mouse and fingers to click images of icons and access files, programs, and folders on our devices. However, this is just one way for us to communicate with computers. The command line is a quick, powerful, text-based interface developers use to more effectively and efficiently communicate with computers to accomplish a wider set of tasks. Learning how to use it will allow you to discover all that your computer is capable of!

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
